# Admission Prediction Data Analysis

- This is a part of my proficiency examination in my bachelors degree, Here i have taken a dataset from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions).
+ In this project I have done in depth Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- With the data insights i have used linear regression(I can choose better algorithm but my problem statement wants me to use linear regression) as my algorithm after which i trained and tested my model.
- Evaluated performance based on metrics such as R-squared value, Mean Square Error, Root MSE, Mean Absolute Error. 
- Finally i plotted a scatter plot to show the regression line
